Proto-Scan - This is a forked beta version, but is functional for most flags that are currently implemented.  Read below.
========
This is a multi-protocol scanner currently only supporting DICOM medical imaging devices and SMB scanning.  More to come later.

This is a beta version as not everything is perfect yet, but getting there in my free time.

Lesson Learned
===

For information about each, check out the individual repositories.  I don't feel like keeping to logs.  :)

Dependencies:
=============

Same as smb-scan and dicom-scan.

Usage:
======

```bash
./protoscanner.py -h (Note:  Only -dicom flags will also require a port.)
```


Enjoy.
